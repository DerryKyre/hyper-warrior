# hyper-warrior

NOT COMPATIBLE WITH NGSP, PR, SP...

YOU NEED MY TERA-SHARED-STATE MOD FOR THIS TO WORK!! (Still need it)

Command: wui -> open mod UI (Works)

Use warrior basic attack to do the rotation (includes smart prevention to not use brooch, gamble, root, ult if not close to boss...) (Works)

Speeds up all animations and ends them faster. (Works, but bad)

Waiting for better fix.

Tested on version *100.02*
