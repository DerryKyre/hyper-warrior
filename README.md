# hyper-warrior

Fixed version of this error: "Cannot read property '17010402' of undefined"

NOT COMPATIBLE WITH NGSP, PR, SP...

YOU NEED "gh.c/salchyy/shared-tera-state" MOD FOR THIS TO WORK..! (Still need it)

Command: /8 wui     -> Open mod UI.
Command: /8 warrior -> (En-);(Dis-)..able the mod.

Use warrior basic attack to do the rotation (includes smart prevention to not use brooch, gamble, root, ult if not close to boss...) (Works)

Speeds up all animations and ends them faster. (Works, but bad)

Waiting for better fix.

Tested on version *100.02*
